# Area73
A heavily modified version of Raider, a Fortnite gameserver that allows you to host on version 3.5, but for 7.3

# How to host
Extract the SDKs.zip file, and make sure the SDKs are defined.
It is **HIGHLY** recommended that all players join after the 2 FortWorldManager things load, this source is highly unstable.
